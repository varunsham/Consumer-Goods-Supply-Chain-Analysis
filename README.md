# Consumer-Goods-Supply-Chain-Analysis
Supply chain analytics plays a crucial role in driving data-driven decision-making across industries, including manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. In this report, I presented an analysis of a Fashion and Beauty startup's supply chain data, specifically focused on the movement of makeup products. By collecting, analyzing, and interpreting this dataset, I aim to gain insights that can inform strategic decisions and optimize supply chain operations.

The dataset comprises various features related to the fashion and makeup product supply chain. These features provide valuable information for understanding the flow of products from suppliers to customers. The following features are included:

Product Type
SKU
Price
Availability
Number of products sold
Revenue generated
Customer demographics
Stock levels
Lead times
Order quantities
Shipping times
Shipping carriers
Shipping costs
Supplier name
Location
Lead time
Production volumes
